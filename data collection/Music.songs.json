[Verse 1] I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring He argued with me about everything He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, \\\"Dude, nice try\\\" But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end Another song, another club, another bar, another dance And when he said something wrong, he'd just fly me to France So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed 'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down If I had to choose, I would say right now [Chorus] I wanna get him back I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad Oh, I wanna get him back 'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again I want to get him back, back, back [Verse 2] So I write him all these letters, and I throw them in the trash 'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh Yeah, I pour my little heart out, but as I'm hitting \\\"send\\\" I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do He said I was the only girl, but that just wasn't the truth And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin' But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him [Chorus] I wanna get him back I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad Oh, I wanna get him back 'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again I want to get him back (And then? And then) I want to get him back, back, back [Bridge: Olivia Rodrigo, Alexander 23] I wanna key his car (I want to get him back) I wanna make him lunch (But then I, I want to get him back; Woo) I wanna break his heart (But then I, I want to get him back; Yeah, you got it) Then be the one to stitch it up (But then I, I want to get him back; yeah) Wanna kiss his face (But then I, I want to get him back) With an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back) I wanna meet his mom (But then I, I want to get him back) Just to tell her her son sucks (But then I, I want to get him back) Oh, I wanna key his car, I wanna make him lunch (But then I, I want to get him back; I want to) I wanna break his heart, stitch it right back up (But then I, I want to get him back; get him back) I wanna kiss his face with an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back; I want to) I wanna meet his mom, and tell her her son sucks, yeah (But then I, I want to get him back; get him back) [Chorus] I wanna get him back I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad Oh, I wanna get him back 'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again I want to get him back (And then?

  "lyrics": "We were both young when I first saw you I close my eyes and the flashback starts I'm standing there On a balcony in summer air See the lights, see the party, the ball gown See you make your way through the crowd And say Hello Little did I know That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet And I was crying on the staircase Begging you, Please don't go And I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone n You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess It's a love story, baby, just say yes So I sneak out to the garden to see you We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew So close your eyes Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet But you were everything to me I was begging you, Please don't go And I said Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is runYou'll be the prince, and I'll be the princessIt's a love story, baby, just say yes Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feelThis love is difficult, but it's real Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess It's a love story, baby, just say yes Oh, oh-oh I got tired of waitingWondering if you were ever coming around My faith in you was fading When I met you on the outskirts of town And I said Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone I keep waiting for you, but you never comeIs this in my head? I don't know what to think He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ringAnd said Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be aloneI love you, and that's all I really knowI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dressIt's a love story, baby, just say yes Oh, oh-ohOh, oh-oh, oh'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"
